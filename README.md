## Description

An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes using Node and Express, utilizing JSON for data storage. With an already completed front-end, my role was to build the back-end and connect it to the front-end, as stated below:

    * The application frontend has already been created, it's your job to build the backend and connect the two.

    * The following HTML routes should be created:

      * GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.

      * GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

    * The application should have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

    * The following API routes should be created:

      * GET `/api/notes` - Should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

      * POST `/api/notes` - Should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

      * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.
